A project translate  blheli_s to c language, because i want to use stm32/or other mcu to control it.

I make a lot of comments and draw the flow chart for the blheli-s 


----  here is the original readme-----


This tree contains BLHeli code for sensorless brushless motor electronic speed control (ESC) boards.

Or for BLHeliSuite32 [here](https://github.com/bitdump/BLHeli/releases).  
Or the BLHeli_32 app [here](https://github.com/bitdump/BLHeli/tree/master/BLHeli_32%20ARM/BLHeli_32%20Android%20APP) or from Google Play.  
  
BLHeli was the first code developed, written in assembly for Atmel and Silabs 8bit MCUs.  
Three versions of the code were made, for heli main motor, tail motor and for multirotor.  
The code is open sourced under GPLv3.  

BLHeli_S was the second code developed, written in assembly for Silabs 8bit MCUs.  
BLHeli_S only supports multirotor applications, although it can also be used for planes.  
For BLHeli_S, focus was on making throttle response smooth.  
The code is open sourced under GPLv3.  

BLHeli_32 was the third code developed, written for 32bit MCUs.  
BLHeli_32 also only supports multirotor applications, although it can also be used for planes.  
The code is closed source.
